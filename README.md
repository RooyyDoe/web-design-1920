# Drag & Drop Weekly schedule

I am making a Drag & Drop weekly schedule for Marijn. He will be able to make he's own weekly schedule in this application. Marijn works five days in the week at FUGA. In this company he has a crucial role in shaping designing and programming. The weelky schedule needs to be easily organized, this will happen through the keyboard. The list will also be able to work with the trackpad. This weekly schedule will help Marijn in he's daily/weekly needs and will help him get all the tasks he needs to do organized.

## Who is Marijn?

Marijn has a motor disorder and rides a wheelchair. This did not stop him from completing high school in five years so that he could study at a technical university. Marijn eventually went on to study information technology at the TUE because of the ultimate passion for computers.

**Assumptions**
- Marijn can only use the right side of the keyboard. (Enter, Arrow keys, Shift)
- Marijn is unable to use a mouse
- Marijn is difficult to understand, so you have to have the utmost concentration to understand what he means.
- Marijn is also nerdy herself, so you can use more difficult language to explain things.
- Marijn does not use a tab to go through a page.
- Marijn likes to be surprised with ideas and doesn't give away much of what he likes to see.

We also have asked Marijn certain questions about himself and how he is working with the computer. These will be found in my [Wiki](https://github.com/RooyyDoe/web-design-1920/wiki/Eerste-gesprek-met-Marijn) (Dutch)

The main thing we wanted to discover as a group was who Marijn was and what he does for a living. In this online meeting we talked about hes hobbies and also about why he disliked the Drag & Drop. We did not have a great prototype that we could test with at that moment.

## The second user test

In the second user test our teacher went to Marijn to help us out with an extra webcam, so that we could exactly see what Marijn was doing with he's hands. This helped a lot with seeing how Marijn is working with the computer and that we really need to make or applications the way he prefers it. the communication with Marijn was better then the first user test, because our teacher was right next to him and helped him with everything and would explain it a second time if we did not understand what Marijn was saying.

### First prototype:

<img width="1440" alt="Schermafdruk 2020-04-16 08 01 48" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40355914/79420119-8af14880-7fb8-11ea-81cc-4d7478b59d7c.png">

In this prototype you are able to move the activity blocks around like a Drag & Drop. The prototype at this moment is not made with the needs of Marijn yet. I just wanted to see how he could move around the activity blocks and how he was struggling with  in this process.

 #### Questions
 
 > When you working on a project for work and you're making use of SCRUM are you writing the tasks urself?
 
Marijn told me that he has assistents that do this for him, (As a joke) but he doesn't like typing so he asked if I could implement an autocomplete on the activity blocks. This will mean that if you start typing a letter it will come up with suggestions that you have written down before.

> Which keyboard buttons do you use most to navigate?

Marijn told me to use the H J K L keys on the keyboard to navigate through the schedule. He used these buttons before and knows how they work. The are used on old programming programs. On this way you can really make it a invidual application for Marijn.

> Which different metal bands are you a fan of?

As a personal question I wanted to know what bands Marijn liked. Maybe in the future I can use this to make the application even more personal for Marijn. He told us that he liked Gojira the most. I have never heard of them before, but I will take this with me in the process.

> What would you use a weekky planning for?

Marijn told me that he is using a planning for work. In this planning he has different activities that he needs to achieve at the end of the week/day.
 
 #### Improvements
 
 - Making use of the H J K L keys to navigate through the weekly schedule.
 - Marijn needs to be able to select an activity block and move it around with he's keyboard.
 - The text in the activity blocks needs to be editable.
 - The text in the acitvity blocks needs autocomplete so that Marijn doesn't have to type full messages.
 - Use the Y key to select the activity block
 - Use the P key to drop the selected activity block
 - Use focus and hover within the weekly schedule
 - Make it more personal and use the design principes for this aswell.
 - Color does not apply for Marijn he likes static colors. (Dark/light theme?)
