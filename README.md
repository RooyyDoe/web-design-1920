# Drag & Drop Weekly schedule

I am making a Drag & Drop weekly schedule for Marijn. He will be able to make he's own weekly schedule in this application. Marijn works five days in the week at FUGA. In this company he has a crucial role in shaping designing and programming. The weelky schedule needs to be easily organized, this will happen through the keyboard. The list will also be able to work with the trackpad. This weekly schedule will help Marijn in he's daily/weekly needs and will help him get all he's tasks organized.

## The first user test

Marijn has a motor disorder and rides a wheelchair. This did not stop him from completing high school in five years so that he could study at a technical university. Marijn eventually went on to study information technology at the TUE because of the ultimate passion for computers.

**Assumptions**
- Marijn can only use the right side of the keyboard. (Enter, Arrow keys, Shift)
- Marijn is unable to use a mouse
- Marijn is difficult to understand, so you have to have the utmost concentration to understand what he means.
- Marijn is also nerdy herself, so you can use more difficult language to explain things.
- Marijn does not use a tab to go through a page.
- Marijn likes to be surprised with ideas and doesn't give away much of what he likes to see.

We also have asked Marijn certain questions about himself and how he is working with the computer. These will be found in my [Wiki](https://github.com/RooyyDoe/web-design-1920/wiki/Eerste-gesprek-met-Marijn) (Dutch)
